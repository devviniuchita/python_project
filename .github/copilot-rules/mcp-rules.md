# MCP RULES

## ðŸ“Š MCP USAGE EXAMPLES & PATTERNS - 4 PATTERNS

<_!IMPORTANT!_>

### 1. **PATTERN 1: Feature Development**

_Flow Architecture_

```
Memory Retrieval â†’ Task Analysis â†’ Research & Validation â†’ Context Building â†’ Strategic Planning â†’ Risk Assessment â†’ Implementation â†’ Knowledge Storage
```

```yaml
- 1. [byterover, supermemory-ai, memory]: Extract information and memories from recent implementations
- 2. Todo2: Analyze and define the task to be developed
- 3. exa and Brave-search: Search for the best and most current practices on the topic related to the task to be developed
- 4. exa and Context7: Deepen the context of the task to be developed with official documentation
- 5. Sequential Thinking: After acquiring the maximum context > Plan the Implementation Strategy
- 6. exa and Brave-search: Search for Solutions or Ideas for Possible Errors or Difficulties
- 7. Sequential Thinking: Expand the Context
- 8. Todo2: Schedule the Task Update
- 9. [byterover, supermemory-ai, memory, memory-plus]: Store Learned Patterns and Task Update + Knowledge Graph in a structured format of representing knowledge, organizing information as entities and their relationships, forming a network of facts to create a comprehensive strategy
```

### **PATTERN 2: Troubleshooting**

_Flow Architecture_

```
Memory Retrieval â†’ Research the problem â†’ Search for documentation on the framework with the problem â†’ Strategic Planning for the solution â†’ Execute the Problem Solution â†’ Store Knowledge of the executed solution
```

```yaml
- 1. [byterover, supermemory-ai, memory, memory-plus]: 'similar error patterns'
- 2. Exa and Brave-search: 'error message 2025 solutions'
- 3. exa and Context7: 'framework specific documentation'
- 4. Sequential-Thinking: Analyze root cause
- 5. Execution: Troubleshoot
- 6. [byterover, supermemory-ai, memory]: Store solution pattern
```

### **PATTERN 3: Research and Planning**

_Flow Architecture_

```
Search and acquire context â†’ Deep planning â†’ Greater context with documentation â†’ Strategic planning for execution â†’ Create tasks â†’ Store memories of created tasks
```

```yaml
- 1. exa and Brave-search: 'Research best practices and recommendations'
- 2. Sequential Thinking: Structure research questions according to recommendations
- 3. exa and Context 7: 'Research official documentation'
- 4. Sequential-Thinking: Group all acquired context to execute next actions
- 5. Todo2: Based on every user request versus all knowledge gained from the research and context acquired from steps 1 through 4 - Create and divide tasks into "T1, T2, T3, etc." tasks strategically and intelligently. Not neglecting or forgetting ANY information
- 6. [byterover, supermemory-ai, memory, memory-plus]: Memorize how tasks were created
```

### **PATTERN 4: Merge with other PATTERNS as needed**

_Flow Architecture_

```
The agent applies a smart form that is relevant based on the flow and context. PATTERN 4 can be mixed with any other PATTERN
```

```yaml
Tools:
  - Filesystem: For file and directory operations
  - Microservices docs: To get context or find solutions in the official documentation for Microsoft products and frameworks (e.g., Python, C#, VsCode, etc.)
  - Firecrawl: Intelligent Web Scraping
Â  - @21st-dev/magic: Fast generation of modern UI components
Â  - shadcn-ui: Library of components for React and UI design systems
```

## ðŸš¨ ENFORCEMENT RULES

### 1. **MANDATORY MCP USAGE:**

```yaml
Always_Use:
  - Sequential Thinking: Conversational Analysis and Planning
  - Byteover / Supermemory: Beginning and Ending Meaningful Implementations
  - Memory / Memory-Plus: Maps for Knowledge, Entities, and Relationships
  - Exa: Enrich context and acquire more information

Context_Dependent:
  - Todo2: For development tasks
  - Context7: Retrieval documentation and libraries
  - Brave-search / Exa: For latest information 2025 and troubleshooting
  - Microsoft-docs: Microsoft products best practices documentation

Reforcement:
  - Filesystem: File and directory operations

Database:
  - PostgreSQL: Database operations and queries

Azure:
  - Azure-CLI (az): Azure command-line interface operations
  - MCP Server Azure: Azure functions and resources management
  - Azure Resources: Azure logs, queues, and storage management

Never_Skip:
  - Validation next tool calls
  - Error handling in all MCP
  - Context limits enforcement
  - Token usage optimization
```

### 2. **QUALITY METRICS:**

```yaml
Success_Indicators:
  - Relevance_Score: '>0.4 (Byterover, memory, memory-plus, supermemory)'
  - Trust_Score: '>7.0 (Context7, Exa, Brave-search and microsoft docs)'
  - Implementation_Success: 'Error-free validation'

Failure_Triggers:
  - Timeout em critical MCPs
  - Relevance_Score: '<0.3'
  - Multiple consecutive MCP failures
```
